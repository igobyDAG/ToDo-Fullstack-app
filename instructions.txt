This is your opportunity to showcase your skill to us. You are absolutely welcome and encouraged to ask
questions if you need clarification.
1. Please build a full-stack solution for a ToDo Web App, this application should be divided in a web app
(using ReactJS) and an API for all the CRUD transactions you need
2. Using your favorite unit test framework, write the unit tests you feel are necessary to adequately test the
code you wrote as your answer to question one.
3. Create a ReactJS web interface that will allow someone to use the ToDo web app, we talk about at point
number one.
4. All the tasks should be stored in a database, you can use any type of database you want.
5. You can add as much functionality as you want, but the basic features, should be the following: show the
complete list of tasks, these tasks should contain, a title, description creation date, and the status (pending
or completed), a way we can add new tasks, a mechanism of deleting and existing tasks, and a mechanism
to complete or return to pending status.
6. Submit your code by a public or private repository like github. Your repository should include instructions
on how to set up, compile & run your application. You can assume your instructions will be read by a
developer.
7. We will look at your GUI, API, DB layers so itâ€™s important we are able to compile and run your
application. Please also provide the database files (scripts, documents, etc.) for creating the schema (if
using a relational db) and populating the required data.
