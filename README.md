# ToDo App Fullstack project

This repo contains two directories:

- frontend: a Vite project using React, vitest and react-testing-library for UI.
- backend: an ExpressJS app for taking requests.

## How to run

To install the project we need to install both front and backend:

```bash
yarn run install
```

Then we run the backend (make sure nothing is running on port 3000):

```bash
yarn run start:backend
```

Then to run the frontend we need to open a new termial on the same directory as this repo and run:

```bash
yarn run start:frontend
```

We can then open a browser on the URL:
[localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

This should run the app
